# Regression-and-it-types

California Housing Prices Regression Analysis
This Jupyter Notebook (regression-and-its-types.ipynb) performs a regression analysis on the California Housing Prices dataset, exploring various regression techniques to predict median house values.
Dataset
The California Housing Prices dataset includes features like:

Median income
Housing median age
Average rooms, bedrooms, and occupancy
Population
Latitude and longitude
Ocean proximity (categorical)

The target variable is the median house value.
Objectives

Apply and compare different regression algorithms.
Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Visualize actual vs. predicted values.
Explain regression techniques for continuous target prediction.

Regression Techniques
The notebook covers:

Linear Regression: Models linear relationships.
Ridge Regression: Linear regression with L2 regularization.
Lasso Regression: Linear regression with L1 regularization.
Polynomial Regression: Captures non-linear patterns.
Decision Tree Regression: Non-linear tree-based model.
Random Forest Regression: Ensemble method for better accuracy.

Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need:

Python 3.11+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Libraries:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn



Notebook Structure

Data Preprocessing:
Load and clean data (remove missing values).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., ocean_proximity).
Split into training/testing sets.
Standardize features.


Model Implementation:
Train each regression model.
Predict on the test set.


Evaluation:
Calculate MSE and R² Score.
Plot actual vs. predicted values.


Visualization:
Scatter plots for actual vs. predicted values.
Red dashed line for perfect predictions.



How to Run

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-regression.git


Navigate to the directory:cd california-housing-regression


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Start Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook


Open regression-and-its-types.ipynb and run the cells.

Results

Performance Metrics: MSE and R² scores for each model.
Visual Insights: Scatter plots showing prediction accuracy.
Observations:
Linear Regression is a simple baseline.
Ridge and Lasso handle overfitting and feature selection.
Random Forest often performs best due to its ensemble nature.



Potential Improvements

Try hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
Explore feature engineering.
Use cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Test advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
