### Overview

This project provides a detailed explanation and implementation of Regression techniques, a fundamental concept in Machine Learning.
Regression is used to model and analyze the relationships between variables and to predict continuous outcomes.

This Jupyter Notebook (regression-and-its-types.ipynb) performs a regression analysis on the California Housing Prices dataset, exploring various regression techniques to predict median house values.

### Dataset

The California Housing Prices dataset includes features like:
- Median income



- Housing median age



Average rooms, bedrooms, and occupancy



Population



Latitude and longitude



Ocean proximity (categorical)

The target variable is the median house value.
